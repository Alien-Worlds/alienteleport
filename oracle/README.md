## Config file
See the ***config-example.js*** for the structure of the config file.

***endpoints*** is an array of different endpoints which are evenly used. For a higher reliability the oracle switches automatically to another endpoint if one fails. ***epVerifications*** defines the number of different endpoints which has to verify the same request. This protects the Oracle from manipulated data of hijacked endpoints in the ***endpoints*** array as long as there are less hijacked endpoints than ***epVerifications***. Set it to 1 to disable multiple verification.

On default ***config.js*** will be used. To specify another config file use the command --config or -c 
```
yarn eos -c {path}
```
